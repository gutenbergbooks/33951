<h3 class="pattern"><a name="Gentlemens_Knitted_Gloves" id="Gentlemens_Knitted_Gloves"></a><i>Gentlemen’s Knitted Gloves.</i></h3>

<p class="material">Four needles No. 15, and fine German lambs’-wool.</p>

<p>Cast on 88 stitches, 28 on each of 2 needles, and 32 on the 3rd, knit
round, knitting and ribbing 4 stitches alternately; when you have done
about one inch, continue with plain <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>knitting<a name="FNanchor_2-1_1" id="FNanchor_2-1_1" href="#Footnote_2-1_1" class="fnanchor">2-*</a> until your glove is
long enough to begin increasing for the thumb, which is done by knitting
twice in one stitch (that is, when you have knitted the stitch, knit it
again at the back before you slip it off the needle,) in the middle of a
needle. Knit a plain round; then increase twice in every other round
before and after the last increase; continue this until you have
stitches enough for the thumb (about 29); take all the stitches except
those for the thumb, on two <i>other</i> needles; divide the stitches for the
thumb on 3 of your 4 needles and knit round, decreasing gradually at the
join towards the end; take the remaining stitches, about 9, on a worsted
needle and sew it up. Divide the stitches for the hand again on your
needles, taking up 5 stitches at the bottom of the thumb for the gusset;
knit two rounds; in the next three rounds decrease 3 stitches of the
gusset: knit plain until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> glove is long enough to begin the fingers;
begin with the first finger, which will require 27 stitches, decrease as
you may think fit at the end of the finger. This will leave 25, 23, and
21 stitches for the 3 succeeding fingers. When you have finished the
first finger, you must take up 4 stitches at the bottom for a gusset,
these may be decreased or not according to the size required.</p>


<h3 class="pattern"><a name="Netted_Gloves" id="Netted_Gloves"></a><i>Netted Gloves.</i></h3>

<p class="material2">The mesh to net these gloves should be No. 14, and the netting silk
fine.</p>

<p>Begin on a round foundation of 50 stitches; net 6 rounds, net 1 round,
putting the silk twice round the mesh, this is to make a place to run
the ribbon in; net 6 rounds, then begin to increase for the thumb by

stitches are required, net round and finish like the thumb; the other
fingers are done in the same way, except that you must make a gusset of
two stitches, which are not to be decreased, at the bottom of the

<h3 class="pattern"><a name="Feather_Gloves" id="Feather_Gloves"></a><i>Feather Gloves.</i></h3>

<p class="material">Four needles No. 19, and very fine cotton are required.</p>

<p>Cast 64 stitches on 1 needle, and 38 on each of the other two: knit
round, knitting and ribbing 5 stitches alternately until you have half
an inch. Then knit a round, putting the cotton <i>round the needle</i>, and
knitting 2 stitches taken together, this is to make a runner for the
ribbon. Knit 3 rounds plain. Knit the stitches of the first needle plain
and begin the feather pattern for the back with the second needle, bring
the cotton forward knit a stitch, repeat this twice, decrease by
knitting 2 stitches taken together 3 times, knit 1 stitch, which is the
centre stitch of the pattern, decrease 3 times, increase 3 times, and
repeat these 19 stitches until you come to the needle with 64 stitches,
which is always plain knitting. Knit 3 rounds. Repeat these 4 rounds
until the glove is long enough to begin to increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> for the thumb:
after the 3 plain rounds, knit 1 stitch, increase 1 by taking up a
stitch between 2 stitches, knit 1, increase 1: continue to increase in
the same manner before and after the last increase, every other round,
continuing the pattern on the 2 needles as before. When you have 9
stitches for the thumb, and have knitted the round without increasing,
knit a stitch, bring the cotton forward, knit a stitch, knit 2 stitches
taken together, knit a stitch (this is to be the centre stitch of the
thumb), knit 2 taken together, bring the cotton forward, knit a stitch,
knit 1 stitch, increase as before.</p>

<p>When you have knitted the 3 rounds, increasing as usual, on the 1st
needle, knit 1 stitch, increase 1, bring the cotton forward, knit a
stitch, repeat this, decrease twice, knit the centre stitch, decrease
twice, increase twice, increase the stitch for the thumb. In the next
round of the holes of the <i>pattern</i> you will have 17 stitches for the
thumb: increase as usual, knit 2 stitches, increase twice, decrease
twice; knit the centre stitch, decrease twice, increase twice, knit 2,
increase 1. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> future you will have stitches enough to make the pattern
down the thumb like the pattern at the back, which is to be done with
the 19 middle stitches of the thumb, the rest on either side are to be
knitted plain: when you have increased 45 stitches and knitted 1 round,
take all the other stitches on 2 <i>other</i> needles, and knit the thumb
round, gradually decreasing a few stitches at the join. When the thumb
is finished take the stitches for the hand on your needles as before,
take up 5 stitches for the gusset at the bottom of the thumb, and
continue knitting as before, (on the third needle you will have an odd
stitch, which belongs to the 1st needle, it will prevent any mistake if
you pass it on to the 1st needle); after doing a few rounds, decrease
the gusset stitches until you have 64 stitches on the 1st needle:
continue the pattern as before, and when the glove is long <a name="corr2" id="corr2"></a>enough, begin
the 1st finger with the first plain 20 stitches and the opposite 19;
knit round, continuing the pattern down the outside of the finger: when
you have done this finger, take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> up 4 stitches for the gusset at the
bottom of the 1st finger,<a name="FNanchor_8-1_2" id="FNanchor_8-1_2" href="#Footnote_8-1_2" class="fnanchor">8-*</a> 16 plain stitches, and 19 of the pattern.
The other 2 fingers are done in the same manner: 14 plain stitches, 19
of the pattern, for the third finger, and 12 plain stitches and 19 of
the pattern for the 4th finger, these numbers do not include the gusset
stitches.</p>

<p>When finished, sew a piece of lace round the top, and run a narrow
ribbon in the holes.</p>

Increase again in the next round before and after the stitches in which
you increased before; net 2 rounds. Continue to increase 2 stitches
every 3rd round until you have increased 7 times on each side, (to make
the thumb fit nicely, the increase stitches should be made <i>over</i> each
other for the last 3 times.) Net 1 round and the 14 thumb stitches. Net
the thumb round for a round or two, and decrease by netting 2 together,
if necessary, until the thumb fits tight; when it is nearly long enough
net 1 round, 2 stitches in every stitch twice round the mesh; 1 round,
taking the 2 stitches together, on a finer mesh, and 2 rounds on the
fine mesh to finish. Cut off the silk, and fasten it on at one side of
the thumb, make 2 stitches on each side and continue to net until the
mitten is long enough. Finish the hand in the same way in which the
thumb was finished. If it be thought an improvement, the 4 last rows can

netting 1 round with double silk <i>twice</i>, and 3 rounds with single silk
<i>once</i>, round the mesh. To finish the hand, fasten on the silk at the
side of the thumb, make 2 additional stitches on each side, (if after 2

care must be taken that the thick part comes over the open part in the
last pattern. In the round which follows, net 11 stitches twice round
the mesh, increase 2 stitches in the 12th, net 5, and increase 2

passed twice round the mesh.) The next round is like the 2nd. Net 1
round twice round the mesh; then 1 like the 2nd. Repeat both these
rounds. Net a round passing the silk twice round the mesh, increasing 2
stitches on each side; these additional stitches should be 4 further

<h3 class="pattern"><a name="Moorish_Brioche" id="Moorish_Brioche"></a><i>Moorish Brioche or Cushion.</i></h3>

<p class="material2">Choose any number of colored wools, or if preferred, two that
contrast well. Two needles, No. 12.</p>

<p>Cast on 60 stitches, bring the wool forward, slip a stitch, knit 1, (by
this you increase by a loop stitch,) bring the wool forward, slip a
stitch, knit 1; repeat these stitches to the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> of the row. 2nd row:
bring the wool forward, slip a stitch, knit the loop made last row with
the next stitch, bring the wool forward, slip a stitch, knit the loop
and stitch together; repeat these stitches to the end of the row. Knit 6
more rows in the same manner, the stitch is the same throughout. Fasten
on the 2nd color, bring the wool forward, slip a stitch, knit 1, bring
the wool forward, slip a stitch, knit 1. Now instead of continuing the
row, turn back. Bring the wool forward, slip a stitch, knit 1, bring the
wool forward, slip a stitch, knit 1. Continue to increase the number you
slip and knit by 4 every time, until all the 60 have been knitted. Knit
8 rows of the 1st color, and proceed as before. Twelve of these
divisions will make the cushion large enough. Sew it up at the side. Net
a fringe with double coarse lambs’-wool to the narrow part, and run in a
string to tie it tightly together under the fringe. Make a round
cushion, and cover it with the knitting.</p>

<p class="material">Two very coarse wooden needles and wool proportionably coarse.</p>

<p>Cast on 30 stitches; knit a few plain rows for the edge; then begin with
the wool forward, slip 1 stitch taking it under so as not to twist it,
knit 1 stitch, repeat these 2 stitches to the end of the row, and you
will find you have increased 15 stitches; repeat this row with this only
difference, that in future you knit the loop and stitch under it
together.</p>

other 9 until both are even, (the loop which is left from carrying the
thread down can be sewn in afterwards); knit 6 more rows double
knitting, and 2 rows double knitting with the thread twice round the
needle. Knit 1 row of plain knitting, increasing 1 stitch in every 2,
which will make in all 27. Then in the front row; knit the 2nd stitch
first, drawing it over the 1st, knit the 1st, knit the 4th and 3rd, 6th
and 5th, and repeat the same to the end, which will be 1 knitted stitch.
Back row; purl the 1st stitch, taking 2 stitches together as if you were
going to decrease, but pick up again the stitch nearest to the right
hand and purl it: repeat this to the last stitch, which is to be purled.
Repeat these 2 rows until you think it long enough, then begin double
knitting, decrease to 18 stitches again, knit about 2 inches and finish
in a point.</p>

<p>These suspenders are firmer and less elastic than those given in the
first series.</p>

<p class="material2">Two wooden needles, No. 10, and for a small muff 1 ounce of blue
and 1 ounce of black fleecy. Double that quantity for a large size.</p>

<p>For a small muff cast on 60 stitches, for a large one 84. The number
must divide into 3 equal numbers. Cast on the stitches with the black
wool, purl 1 row. 2nd row; bring the wool forward and knit 2 stitches
taken together, (every 2nd row with the black wool must begin like this)
bring the wool forward, knit 3 stitches pull the first over the 2 last,
repeat these 3 stitches to the end, when you will find you have one
stitch left, bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> wool forward and knit it. Join on the blue wool
and purl 1 row. 2nd row; bring the wool forward, knit 2 taken together,
knit 2 stitches and pull the stitch in which you decreased over them,
(every 2nd blue row begins thus) bring the wool forward, knit 3 stitches
pull the 1st over the 2 last, repeat these 3 stitches to the end of the
row. Use the black wool and repeat the whole. For a small muff do 21
stripes of each color, for a large one 42. Cast off.</p>

<p>To make up a small muff you must buy 5-8ths of gros-de-naples, 1½ oz.
of fine carded wool and 1 oz. of fine horse-hair. Double the silk in
halves and place on it 1 layer of wool. 1 layer of horse-hair and a
second layer of wool. Quilt these to one-half of the silk and fold the
other half over, and sew it to the knitted cover; turn the muff inside

<h2 class="chapterhead"><a name="TERMS_USED_IN_KNITTING" id="TERMS_USED_IN_KNITTING"></a>TERMS USED IN KNITTING.</h2>


<div class="hanging">
<p><i>A turn</i> means two rows.</p>

<p><i>To turn</i> means to change from plain to purled stitches, or the
reverse.</p>

<p><i>A ridge</i> is formed by two rows when knitting with only two pins.</p>

<p><i>A loop stitch</i> is formed by passing the thread before the needle,
and, in <i>knitting</i> the next stitch, letting it take its usual place.</p>

<p><i>To increase in knitting a Quilt</i>, care should always be taken to
increase by knitting twice through the last stitch, which is done by
knitting a stitch, and then, without taking out the needle, knitting
a second at the back.</p>

<p><i>To fasten on in knitting.</i> It is a secure fastening to lay the two
ends contrary-wise to each other, and knit a few stitches with them
both.</p>

<p><i>To narrow</i> or <i>decrease</i> is to make small, to lessen, as in shaping a
stocking.</p>

<p><i>Ribbed stitch</i>, <i>purl stitch</i>, <i>turned</i>, or <i>seam stitch</i>, are all
terms having the same meaning. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> turned stitch is made by bringing
the cotton before the needle, and instead of putting the needle over
the upper cotton, it is put under.</p>

<p><i>To slip</i>, <i>take off</i>, or <i>pass a stitch</i>, is to change it from one
needle to another without knitting it.</p>

<p><i>To take under</i>, means to pass the right hand needle through the
stitch on the left hand one, so as still to keep the same side of
the stitch towards you.</p>

<p><i>Welts</i> are the rounds of ribbed stitches done at the top of
stockings, to prevent their rolling up.</p>

<p><i>Cast off</i> means to end your work in the following manner: knit 2
stitches, pass the first over the second, and continue the same
until you have but one left, which is finished by passing your
cotton through it.</p>

<p><i>To decrease</i> is to lessen the number of stitches by knitting 2 taken
together.</p>

<p><i>To increase</i>, or <i>make a double stitch</i>, is to knit one stitch in the
usual way, then, without slipping out the left hand needle, to pass
the thread forward and knit a second stitch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> putting the needle
under the stitch. The thread must be put back when the stitch is
finished.</p>

<p><i>Hang on</i>, means cast on.</p>

<p><i>Bring the thread forward</i>, means to pass it between the needles
towards you.</p>

<p><i>Cast over</i> is a term I believe sometimes used by knitters, to
signify, bring the cotton forward. I have only used it to express,
bring the cotton over the needle, quite round.</p>

<p><i>Round the needle</i>, means the same as the last term.</p>

<p><i>Reversed</i>, means quite round the needle, the cotton being passed
<i>over</i> the needle, and then carried back to its place.</p>

<p><i>Together</i>, means knit 2 stitches in 1.</p>

<p><i>Set</i>, or <i>Tuft</i>, the bunches of cotton used in making some of the
Fringes.</p>

<p><i>To widen</i> means to increase.</p>
